# Polls-Application
My first Django Application. I followed the [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/) from the Django Docs.
The project mysite contains the app 'polls'.The app contains:
- 'Question' and 'Choice' Models
- 'IndexView' to list down the latest questions.
- 'DetailView' to show the detail of a particular question inorder for voting in it.
- 'ResultsView' to show the results of the questions' polls so far.

The templates uses HTMX as it lets you build webpages with "expected" functionalities without using js libraries.
